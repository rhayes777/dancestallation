-   Dacemat substitute module, so that I can test without dancemat being plugged in, eg.
    cursor keys as input.

-   Code for opening midi file, and playing/streaming individual parts to different hardware synths
-   Functionality for stopping, starting, fading in and out, and switching each midi part's output device
-   Attempt to send CCs/NRPMs to hardware synths, and again bind these to input controls

---> Next look at:

-   Looping; bound to user input. Eg. user presses buttons, sends some CC messages to synths for 2 bars.
    This is then looped for another 2 bars.
