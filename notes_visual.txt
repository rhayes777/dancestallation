GENERAL AESTHETIC 

I want this to look like some sort of 80s/90s arcade game

-> How will we achieve this?

Research arcade games.....

MAME
Dreamcast
Late Sega console games

Possible ideas to rip:

- A 'score counter'
-> Score would have to be based on something that the user is doing, or it wouldn't feel correct.
-> 'Energy' or 'Life' or ...'music'[?] meter.
-> Timers
-> Checkpoints/'bonuses'

-> Bright colours
-> Explosions!

...-> a 'hi score' table/demo mode

Text...

Text in these games always seems to have a top-to-bottom gradient. Could figure out a function to draw text like this.

What font is used for all these games? Seems to be very similar one






Look at [more modern] rythm games as well.

Some parts of this need to be quite literal. Eg. midi notes being created/affected by the user

Other parts I want to be slightly more mysterious (but perhaps could be figured out given time...)
