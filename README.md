# Dancestallation

Control midi tracks using a USB dancemat.

Input is read from a dancemat and used to alter an existing midi track as it plays. The track can be pitch shifted, harmonic notes generated, channels toggled on and off and tempo shifted. Midi output is patched to different midi instruments and also used to generate pygame graphics.

Ensure you have python and pip

Install the requirements using pip install -r requirements.txt (in the python folder)

A midi synth is required. Software such as SimpleSynth or an external USB synth can be used.
